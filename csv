# Create a file called company-stocks.csv that includes three columns:

# • company_name: The name of the company
# • purchase_date: The purchase date of the stock
# • shares: The number of shares purchased

# Create a script that performs the following tasks:
# • Prompt the user for a company name, purchase date, and number of shares for five
#   different companies.
# • Add each company’s information to a list and add each list to a collection of lists.
# • After all data has been collected from the user, append the new data to company_stocks.csv and 
#   display the file’s contents to the user.
# The data entries should be realistic, even if the data is not real.
